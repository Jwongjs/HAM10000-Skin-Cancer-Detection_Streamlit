# Skin Cancer Image Classification - Run Instructions

## Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended) - Use Pre-trained Model

If you just want to run the web application with our pre-trained model:

1) Create your own virtual environment:
   python -m venv .venv

2) Activate it:
   # Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate

3) Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4) Run the Streamlit application:
   streamlit run mainpage.py

5) The model will be automatically downloaded from Google Drive on first run
   (This may take a few minutes depending on your internet connection)

6) Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8501

## Option 2: Train my fine-tuned Models from Model_training

1) Refer to Training_Instructions.txt under Model_training folder

2) Run the application:
   streamlit run mainpage.py

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Internet connection (for downloading pre-trained model)
- ~200MB free space (for model file)

## Troubleshooting

- If model download fails, check your internet connection
- For training your own model, ensure you have GPU support for faster training
- If you encounter memory issues, try reducing batch size during training

## Model Information

- Architecture: EfficientNet-B0
- Classes: 7 skin lesion types
- Input size: 224x224 pixels
- Pre-trained model validation accuracy: Displayed when app loads

## Note

The pre-trained model is hosted on Google Drive and will be automatically downloaded when you first run the application. This eliminates the need to include large model files in the repository.
